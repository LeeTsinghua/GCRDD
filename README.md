# GCRDD
This is the code for paper Graph Convolution Recurrent Denoising Diffusion Model for Multivariate Probabilistic Temporal Forecasting

## Project Overview
The framework generally extends the probabilistic diffusion method to spatial-temporal forecasting with predefined topology information. In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
– Limited studies consider the structure information in the probabilistic multi-variate time series forecasting model . To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the pioneer applications of the temporal diffusion model with graph knowledge.
– We propose a modified graph diffusion module that was refined from the TimeGrad to capture hidden spatial dependencies among temporal
features. Our method exploits a new field for diffusion models to handle spatial-temporal data.
– Comparing our method with state-of-the-art methods on two spatial-temporal traffic datasets demonstrates its competitive performance
